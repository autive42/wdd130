        <p>Hello! I am from Riverside, California. Snow is still magic to me, but we'll see how long that lasts. I'm currently a student at BYU Idaho. I'm a CSE major with a data science emphasis, though I might switch to cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>I enjoy reading, especially fantasy and sci-fi. One really good book that I read recently was <i>Project Hail Mary</i> by Andy Wier. I also enjoy playing games as well as anime and manga. Right now I've really been enjoying Celeste and Dead Cells.</p>
